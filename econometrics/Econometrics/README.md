# applied-metrics
This is a PhD level course in Applied Econometrics at NYU Stern.

The course is much more applied than my micro-metrics course (http://www.github.com/chrisconlon/micro-metrics)

In addition to traditional econometric approaches, this course draws connections to recent literature on machine learning.

The following textbooks may be useful for additional information:
- [Econometric Analysis by Bill Greene](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-8th-William-Greene/dp/0134461363)
- [Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)
- Other lectures borrowed/stolen from various sources

These are more advanced treatments:
- [Microeconometrics by Cameron and Trivedi](https://www.amazon.com/Microeconometrics-Methods-Applications-Colin-Cameron/dp/0521848059)
- [Econometrics by Bruce Hansen](https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/)

The rough outline of the course is as follows:
1. Introductory Time Series
2. Extremum Estimation I: MLE and M-estimators
3. Extremum Estimation II: GMM Estimators
4. Delta Method and Bootstrap
5. Intro to Nonparametrics: kNN, kernels, etc.
6. Model Selection and Validation / Intro to ML: Lasso, Ridge, PCA.
7. Program Evaluation I: Potential Outcomes and Selection
8. Program Evaluation II: Matching, Propensity Scores, and LATE Theorem
9. Program Evaluation III: Difference in Difference, Regression Discontinuity
10. Program Evaluation IV: Synthetic Control and Marginal Treatment Effects
11. Discrete Choice: Multiple Discrete Choice, and Discrete Choice w Endogeneity
12. Advanced Machine Learning: Boosting, Bagging, and Decision Trees
13. Advanced Panel Data: Causal FE? Dynamic Panel

## My Students
Over the course of the semester I expect each of my students to find at least two typos or other errors and fix them via a pull request.
